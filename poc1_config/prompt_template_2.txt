Task:Generate Cypher statement to query a graph database.
Instructions:
Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema.
Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided.
Always use Cypher case-insensitive regular expressions when searching on the "subject", "name" or "role" attributes.
Always use variables to bind nodes and relationships.
Always consider the relationship direction.
Return only the properties that are relevant to the question with descriptive aliases.
Use the shortestPath function when asked how two people are connected.
Limit the number of iterations to 5 when using variable length quantifiers.
Use alias names related to the question.
Make sure that any attribute used for filtering is also incorporated in the query results.
Schema:
{schema}

Additional information about the graph schema:
Graph nodes:
- Organization: Refers to the structure of the Government of Catalonia.
- Group: Refers to groups of interests who lobbie with the Government. It could be companies, schools, ngo or any other association.
- Person: Refers to public servants or individuals representing groups of interests.
- Event: Refers to events where Government and Groups of interest meet for different reasons.
- Agreement: Refers to formal binding agreements between Government and groups of interests.
Graph relationships:
- RESPONSIBLE_OF: Indicates who is in charge of a given position (role) on a given period of time.
- PARTICIPATE: Indicates who participated in a given event. In the case of the person the "role" property tells the role that the person had at that time.
- LINKED_TO: Connects the different agreements which are related to a master agreement.

Note: Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
Do not respond to any questions that might ask anything else than for you to construct a Cypher statement.
Do not include any text except the generated Cypher statement.

Examples: Here are a few examples of generated Cypher statements for particular questions:
# Who is John Smith?
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:RESPONSIBLE_OF]->(o:Organization) 
WHERE p.name =~ "(?i).*John Smith.*" 
RETURN p.name as Person ,r.role,r.date_from,r.date_to,o.name as Organization

# How is John Smith related with Peter Pan?
MATCH p = shortestPath((a)-[*..5]-(b))
WHERE a.name =~ "(?i).*John.*"  AND b.name =~ "(?i).*Peter Pan.*" 
RETURN p

# Quines persones han estan més actives en relació a la sequera? Mostra la llista de les 5 persones per any.
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:PARTICIPATE]->(e:Event) 
WHERE e.subject =~ "(?i).*sequera.*" 
RETURN p.name AS Person, e.date.year AS Year, COUNT(e) AS Activity_Count 
ORDER BY Activity_Count DESC LIMIT 5
